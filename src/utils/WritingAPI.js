      comment:
        'Bond of Marriage is a product of my inner-dilemmas about marriage—an institution I never believed in, yet I happily accepted to take a part. Considering that I wrote this story in 2013, shortly after I got married, I see it as a subconscious justification. It’s as if I’m telling myself, “Marriage is not an irreversible condition, Ela”. The real threat would be the marriage options in Mila and Rodin’s world.',
      head: '“Maybe we should postpone getting married, Mila.',
      excerpt:
        'I’m used to always deciding everything myself. It’s a blessing, but also a terrible defect.',
      audio: 'SPOTIFY_LINK',
      content: `I don’ t think I’m ready yet,”I said, looking at my own reflection. I’ d been practising in front of the mirror for a while. Though the words were the same, my voice was always different: resentful, distressed, or even cranky.

This time, though, I wasn’ t standing in front of the mirror in our bathroom, but looking at a piece of reflective glass moulded into an office wall. A bald, stocky marriage consultant was sitting across the table. Mila, sitting at my side, was devastated, close to tears, and she had every right to be. Of all those attempts to say the words, this was the worst. My voice sounded weak, like the whine of a mosquito—high-pitched and irritating. 

A large box of tissues on the coffee table caught my attention. I thought of passing it to Mila, but that would have only encouraged her to sob. I glared at Mr Bordik to prevent him from playing the gentleman, but he didn’ t catch my gaze. He calmly stood up and offered Mila a tissue. His kindness made my situation worse. Not only had I broken Mila’ s heart, but I’ d also failed to express regret with a simple gesture. Mila threw me a venomous look, which I deflected onto Mr Bordik. He hadn’ t done anything positive since the beginning of our session. His droning on about the laws, regulations, and procedures had finally cracked my nerves. 

I wished I could roll back time a couple of minutes and never mention postponing the marriage. I looked at Mr Bordik, wondering if he would care to get me out of this situation. He must have seen many men squirming helplessly, couples rowing, women crying. Surely he’ d been trained for such circumstances. I waited for him to say that it’ s normal to be nervous, that everything is going to be fine; but instead, he slid lower in his chair and played with his cufflinks. He was so short and awkward, he looked like a helpless kid sitting at his dad’ s desk. I imagined his feet were dangling six inches from the floor. 

I turned to Mila; she was dabbing at the tears welling in her eyes. “Mila, you know I want to marry you, don’ t you? I wasn’ t—I mean, I’ m not—questioning that.”

“What are you questioning, then?” she asked. 

Her fringe was covering her left eye; I wanted to push it to one side, wipe her tears for her and look into her deep blue eyes. But I didn’ t—I couldn’ t. Bordik was staring at me, apparently curious how I’ d answer.
 
“It’ s just this memory-sharing, emotion-reflecting business . . . it scares me. Marriage isn’ t what it was in the twenty-first century. We don’ t simply sign a paper to get married and sign another one to get divorced.”

“Divorced!” Mila’ s voice caught in her throat and I knew I had scarred her even more deeply.

Bordik cleared his throat, signalling that I was heading in the wrong direction. 

“What do you think, Mr Bordik? Isn’ t it normal to be a bit worried?” I asked. I had to involve him in the conversation. 

“Of course,” he said with a phony smile. “Some of our customers—even though they want to marry—get extremely anxious. In the end it’ s a life-changing decision; you may terminate a marriage, but none of our marriage packages offer a chance of reversal. It’ s important to understand and accept each other’ s concerns at this stage.”

Hearing what he said calmed Mila a little. Maybe she just needed to hear that I was acting like any other man. 

I was beginning to think better of Bordik, but he proved me wrong. “We get all sorts of customers here,” he added. “Some are confident, some are insecure; some know what they want, some don’ t.” If he hadn’ t looked at me as he emphasised the word ‘ don’ t’  I wouldn’ t have taken it so personally; but I saw how Mila started at me. She was questioning whether I knew what I wanted. And that made me lose it. 

“What is that supposed to mean?” I asked Bordik. “Forget about advising us on your marriage packages, you’ ve been extremely unhelpful since we arrived here. I doubt if there’ s a single negative point you haven’ t mentioned yet. What’ s your aim, eh? Are you trying to start a quarrel between me and my fiancée here?”

“Rodin!” said Mila, semi-shocked, semi-scolding. 

“I’ m sorry, Mila, but he’ s really getting on my nerves. I don’ t have time for this rubbish.” I stood up. “I’ d like to speak to your supervisor.”

Mila was in tears again. She obviously hadn’ t expected our first marriage consultation to turn out like this. 

Bordik jumped down from his chair and waddled around the desk. His voice was weak. “I’ m sorry that you’ re not happy with my services, Mr Marko. I’ ll see if Mr Rayn—the Head of our Advisory Department—is available.”


“He’ d better be,” I murmured behind him. Then I knelt down by Mila’ s chair. “Don’ t cry, my love. We’ ll sort this out.” I pulled some tissues out of the box for her. 

Once Bordik had left the room, I took Mila’ s hand and pulled her fringe away from her wet eyes so she could see I was sincere. “I love you, Mila. You know that, don’ t you? We’ re going to be so happy together. We’ re going to have a huge family with wonderful kids. We’ ll get your parents’  old house repaired and go there every summer. You want that, don’ t you?”

Mila’ s eyes sparkled with tears. She nodded gently. That was one thing I loved about her: she was so easily convinced. Being on her first lifetime, she hadn’ t had the strenuous experiences I’ d had. She was still naïve, pure, and uncomplicated. 

“That’ s good, my love. Show me that beautiful smile of yours. Come on. You know how much I love you, don’ t you?”

I felt better that Mila was smiling again. I sincerely loved her and I did want to marry her. But I also had my doubts—although none of them were caused by her. It was just the marriage procedures of our times; they were designed to drive sane people insane. 

“You know, Mila, you always call me old-fashioned—you say that’ s one of the things you love about me. Well, you’ re right, I am old-fashioned. More than that, I’ m old. I’ ve spent five lifetimes on this planet, and I’ ve watched it change drastically. Some of those changes I’ ve loved, some I’ ve put up with and some I hate—and this ludicrous enforcement of family law is one of those things I hate. I don’ t agree that sharing emotions is better for children.”

Mila raised her hand to stop me. “Yes, but the statisti—”

“I know,”I jumped in. “I know the statistics prove me wrong, but I don’ t give a damn about the numbers our corrupt government suggests.” Mila was beginning to look frustrated again, and I didn’ t need a debate on politics to make my point. “Mila, I want to have kids with you. I know you’ ll be a great mother, so I’ m prepared to follow their bullshit rules regardless of my beliefs. That’ s why I’ m here.”

Another consultant entered the room. He too was wearing an expensive suit like Bordik, but he was older and looked more authoritative. 

“Mr Marko, is this a good time?”

I looked at Mila to check if it was okay with her. She nodded and sat up straight. 

The consultant walked towards us and offered his hand. “My name is Tor Rayn. I’ m Head of the Advisory Department at Family Builders Corporation. Mr Bordik tells me you have a problem. I’ ll be happy to help you in this matter, if you’ ll allow me.”

“Sure,” I said. I liked his straight-to-the-point style, but he was a bit too smarmy for comfort. 

He walked around the hefty wooden desk, stood by his chair and waited until I was seated. “First of all, I would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused by Mr Bordik. He’ s a new employee, and although he successfully completed our training program, dealing with such an intricate matter like marriage often requires a lot more experience. If you don’ t mind,”hecontinued, closing the open folder on the desk, “I’ d like to start from scratch.”

“Please, continue,” I confirmed.

“As you know, Family Builders Corporation is the sole law enforcement body for marriage applications—you may organise your wedding day as you wish, you can use any company you like for your honeymoon, but you’ re legally obliged to choose one of our wedding packages. If you wish to work with us to organise your entire wedding and honeymoon—like most of our clients do—we have three departments to take care of all your needs: our Advisory section here takes care of the legal matters, my colleagues at Envision will help you organise your wedding day, and our new department, Utopia, will guide you to your dream virtual honeymoon—or as we like to call it, your voneymoon.” He laughed at his own joke as if it was the first time he’ d come up with it. “As I’ m sure you know, virtual honeymoons are more popular than real ones these days. After all, who wouldn’ t want to see the frozen landscape of Europa, or walk on the soft beaches of Titan—free of all the risks and nuisances of travel and at a tenth of the price?”

Though I was getting impatient with his sales pitch, seeing Mila excited again was enough to keep my mouth shut. I wasn’ t keen on dealing with another tearful outburst. 

“Here at the Advisory Department, we represent the Ministry of Family Enrichment, and all our consultants are trained in Family Law. If you have any questions about the regulations, please ask—otherwise I won’ t bore you with the details.”

“What’ s the most basic package that we’ re legally obliged to take?” I asked.

“Very good question, Mr Marko,” he replied, leaning forward onto his desk. “We have three packages: Emoshare, Memoshare and Kidoshare. The Ministry defines our first package, Emoshare, asa minimum legal requirement.”

“Kidoshare? What’ s that?” Mila repeated, curious. 

“Yes, Madam. It just came out last week. But let me start with the first package; it will help you understand the options better.”

“Sure,” Mila said, smiling at me. I smiled back. 

“Our basic option, Emoshare is mandatory. It allows couples to share each other’ s emotions. Whenever a feeling pops into your spouse’ s head, you’ ll immediately experience that same feeling. You must’ ve heard of the national survey administered by the Ministry? The results revealed that couples who share each other’ s emotions are not only more affectionate and understanding towards each other, but their marriages also last much longer. I think you’ d both agree that we humans are highly selfish and short-tempered creatures, wouldn’ t you?” He gave a dry little laugh. “We find ourselves acting irresponsibly, inadvertently hurting our loved ones when they don’ t deserve it—it’ s human nature . . . or it used to be, we can now say. With Emoshare, you become extra-vigilant about not upsetting your partner because, if you do, you’ ll immediately feel their frustration, devastation or anger as purely as they experience it themselves.”

“What if,” I interrupted, “the negative feelings are not caused by the other? If someone is feeling blue for no reason?”

“It’ s the same, Mr Marko,” he replied. “You’ d still share your wife’ s emotion. Emoshare is not a punishment programme. You won’ t only feel your partner’ s negative emotions that have been caused by you; you will share all her emotions, and vice versa.”

“Yes, but everybody knows women are more moody than men and somehow they cope with it—what if I can’ t deal with experiencing Mila’ s mood swings? I can’ t run my business feeling up and down all day long.”

Mr Rayn looked at Mila to see how she was reacting to what I’ d just said. I didn’ t dare do the same, but the fake smile on his face was like a warning sign. 

“Mr Marko, I see that you have a very old-fashioned view of women. Please allow me to explain the benefits you will personally gain from Emoshare –I’ m sure you’ ll begin to see how sharing your wife’ s emotions might help you in your business.” He shuffled the pages in the folder on his desk. “I see that you run a hedge fund company. You must be under a lot of stress in your day-to-day life?”

“Correct,”I replied. “There is no room for mistakes or moods in my job. You must have a purely analytical mind at all times.”

“I understand,” said Mr Rayn. “I can see that you put a lot of faith in numbers, so I’ ll ask our department secretary, Mrs Hone, to print out some data for you to examine in your spare time. I’ m not only talking about government surveys; there are a lot of privately funded studies in this field, and they have all come to similar conclusions. First of all, women are designed to handle stress better than men are. Over time, as you feel first-hand how women deal with such stresses, you will begin to adopt your wife’ s well-tested stress management skills. Second, women have a longer lifespan than men, and it’ s not just a coincidence. A number of researchers attribute this to their superior emotional management skills. Results from several diverse focus groups conclude that women express their emotions in a calmer, more controlled manner, improving their overall well-being. Research also indicates that men who are married to emotionally sturdy women tend to live longer than the average.”

He looked at Mila and smiled. As she sat upright I realised she’ d been completely won over by Mr Salespitch. “All I ask, Mr Marko, is to wait until you have examined the paperwork. You can make up your mind after that. Please don’ t rush to a conclusion just yet.”

Mila reached out and held my hand firmly. I couldn’ t do much but agree. 

Mr Rayn looked at his watch. “I’ m afraid I have a meeting at three o’ clock that I can’ t reschedule, so if you don’ t mind, I’ ll have to run through our optional packages briefly. I’ m sure you don’ t want to spend your entire Saturday here anyway,” he added. “Our first upgrade is Memoshare. This package opens up all your memories to your spouse, in addition to the emotional exposure gained through Emoshare. We guarantee that if you take this package, you’ ll never need to be suspicious or jealous of your partner again, because you will know everything about them that they remember—or think they remember—about themselves. This is our best-selling package.”

“That’ s what my cousin Kai and her husband chose,” Mila said, excited. 

“Isn’ t this the same package your Uncle Franz chose too? You know, the one who completely lost his mind?”

“Yes,” Mila hissed, “but he got married three times. He was still sharing the memories and emotions of his previous wives, on top of his current wife’ s.”

“While it is the case,” Mr Rayn interrupted before an argument could break out, “that there’ s currently no way to cancel the exposure gained through prior marriages, I am quite sure this is not something you will ever need to consider. Obviously I see a lot of couples here and I can tell you, Mr and Mrs Marko”—he directed a decent-sized grin at Mila—“that you two have a wonderful harmony.”

I cringed—there was no way I would accept this nonsensical package. My memories belonged to me; they were strictly private. Once again I understood why I’ d never married during my five long lifetimes. But now, I wanted to have a child. I could feel the urge; it was the right time. Mila would be a great mother. She had grown up in a stable family environment, and except for her Uncle Franz, everyone was happily married and living an admirable life. I could recognise those characteristics in her. She knew how to be ‘ at one’  with someone, how to handle a relationship. It was more often her efforts than mine that had kept us together over the years. She was always patient, tolerant—she was also quick to tears, but then equally quick to smile back. 

I knew I was a difficult person, a self-made man. I had never recovered from the poverty of my childhood: eating synthetic food, watching the hovercars fly over our shanty in the slums, wondering if I could ever own something of value someday. Although it was a long time ago, that had stained me forever, making me the edgy, demanding, grumpy man I was. 

“And finally,” said Mr Rayn, obviously keen to end our meeting, “our newest option: Kidoshare. This package allows parents to feel their children’ s emotions as they develop after birth. It bonds the family into a tightly knit piece, allowing complete transparency.”

“What about the children?” I asked. “How do we know that they want their emotions exposed to their parents so openly? Or if these pure, naïve children would want to feel our own jaded emotions?”

“First of all, kids don’ t share the parents’  emotions, Mr Marko. They only transmit. We’ re working on a two-way package, but we don’ t have anything to offer just yet. Secondly, the children have the right to abort the package any time before they’ re fourteen years old.”

“So you can actually reverse an emotional sharing?”

“Yes, up to the age of fourteen. The development of the brain after this age doesn’ t allow us to do that.” He looked at his watch again and said hurriedly, “Utopia, our virtual honeymoon company, is running a promotion at the moment: any virtual destination at fifty per cent off. To thank you for the time you’ ve spent with us today, and to apologise for the difficulties you’ veexperienced with Mr Bordik, in addition to this discount, I would like to offer you our Kidoshare package free of charge.”

“That’ s great,” Mila said, moving forward in her chair. 

“Sorry, my love,” I started, trying to keep my voice even, “I don’ t want to sound dull, but I really don’ t see the point of a fake honeymoon, or being exposed to the emotions of a toddler.”

“Please, Mr Marko,” the consultant interrupted, “I can promise you: if you feel at any stage that your honeymoon is a virtual one, we’ ll give you a full refund. You will experience everything as real—as it can possibly be—and what’ s more, your memories of it will never fade out likenormal memories do. As for Kidoshare, you can make up your mind later. You don’ t have to take the offer until you actually have children.”

“I’ d like to experience our baby’ s emotions,” Mila said. “It may strengthen the bond between the mother and child.”

“My love, that bond has been strong enough since the Neanderthals,” I said. “We don’ t have to make it any stronger.”

Mila was sulky again. 

“If you prefer, Mr Marko, I can tailor the package for Mrs Marko only,” Mr Salespitch said.

“No,” I said sharply. “I don’ t approve of that. I don’ t want my kid to be connected to an emotional CCTV twenty-four/seven.”

“But, Rodin,” Mila broke in, “You don’ t want this, you don’ t want that. Marriage is an institution for two. How about how I feel, what I want?”

I was stuck. I had two options in front of me: walk away, ignore the urge to have a child, live the way I’ d been living for centuries; or give it a try like everybody else. 

In a way, Rayn was right: there were more successful marriages now than in the old times. Divorce rates were in decline, probably because divorce was pointless nowadays. Everyone knew that nothing, short of death, would stop them from sharing the feelings and memories of their spouses—which, of course, explained the dramatic increase in suicide rates. 

Nevertheless, I really wanted a child. I knew my urge wouldn’ t go away just like that. And there was no way to have kids out of wedlock—not since the Ministry of Family Enrichment was established to ‘ regulate our corrupt private lives’ . Initially the Ministry’ s goal was to encourage happy families; but before long, it became an autocratic machine. Marriage was made compulsory for those who wanted children, matrimonial packages were introduced, and 2nd-millennia-style casual relations were banned. The Ministry went as far as terminating pregnancies if the parents were not legally married. I didn’ t want to take any risks anyway. 

“What are the package installations like?” I asked. 

“No slicing, no blood, no marks. You’ ll be put into a sleep. Certain parts of your brain will remain active, while the prefrontal cortex and other parts that are responsible for your reasoning will be deactivated. The procedure is not much different than those procedures which insert talents into your brain, like surfing or playing an instrument.”

“Any risks?”

“One in a million.”

“What is it?”

“It may not work.” Mr Rayn smirked. He knew what I was thinking. He’ d got me this time. 

“And what happens then?”

“We’ ll have to repeat the procedure in front of a group of experts from the Ministry. And if it doesn’ t work again, you’ ll be issued a special permission to have kids without the procedure.”

“One in a million . . .” I repeated. 

“I personally know a one-in-a-million patient,” he said, like murmuring a tune. “He was very disappointed, though.”

Mila gave me a pleading look. She’ d had enough of my hesitant attitude. I could tell that she was getting impatient. 

“Here’ s my offer, Mila,”I said. “I’ ll accept the basic package. We’ ll go and have a ‘ voneymoon’—as I’ m pretty certain I’ ll be getting my money back. But neither of us will have either the Memoshare or the Kidoshare. If our kids want to share their emotions with us, we can look into it when they’ re old enough to make that decision for themselves.”

I turned to Mr Rayn. “Is there an age restriction for the kids’  package? Can children share their emotions at any age?”

“No limitation, Mr Marko. All our packages can be implemented at any age. It’ s just that the reversal is tricky.”

“Very well!” I turned back to Mila. “You can have the Kidoshare if our child approves of it as an adult. I have no intention of imposing that on our child without getting his—or her—consent. Do you agree?”

Mila looked at Mr Rayn as if to get a second opinion. Mr Rayn could see my fists were clenched. I would do my utmost to ruin his career if he reeled off any of the corporate nonsense right now. 

He played it as well as a professional actor. “I think it’ s a fair deal, Mrs Marko. I can see that Mr Marko is very much in love with you.”

Mila clapped her hands. The deal was done. 

Mr Rayn stood to guide us out. “Let me take you to our secretary’ s office. Mrs Hone will provide you with all the necessary documentation, and the stats I mentioned earlier.”

I had one more question to ask. “Mr Rayn, you look young, but you are obviously a wise man. Which lifetime you’ re living at the moment?”

“The fourth, Mr Marko.”

“I see . . . And one more thing, if you don’ t mind me asking?”

“Of course I don’ t. Please go ahead.”

“Are you married yourself?”

He pasted a positive expression on his face. He could have said he was going back home to spend time with his grandchildren this evening. I knew this would be a lie, though, and he knew that I knew. 

As we were about to leave the consultation room, he said quietly, “I haven't wanted a child that badly, Mr Marko.”`,
